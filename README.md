# Portfolio
Portfolio that demonstrates my understanding of the Computer Science learning goals.

##Files
Along with the five assignments, I have included my Resume and a document explaining the Computer Science learning goals.

##Text Exchange

Text Exchange is my Captsone Project. For my project I wanted to learn mobile development and gain more experiance with the full application development life-cycle (specifically back-end). To obtain this, I built a Android applicatoin. This applicaiton provided a platform for students to trade their used textbooks for ones they may need in the future. 

This project fulfills the Computer Science learning goal "Understand the concepts and technigues of software design". Starting from scratching and building this application into the funcitonal platfrom it is today, I believe this project is a great example of this learnging goal.

##System Architecture Term Paper
SystemArchitectureTermPaper.pdf
The Term Paper for System Architures class is a great example of the Computer Science learning goal "To attain a system level understanding of the computer". In the paper we were tasked with descrbing what System Architecture is. In order to this, I broke up System Architecture into its differnt abstractual layers and explained how each functions. In doing this, I deminstrate my understanding of the relationship between varios levs in a computer system.

##Scuba Steve's Math Adventure

Scuba Steve's Math Adventure is the project my group worked on for my Software Engineering class. I belive it is a great example of the Computer Science learning goal "Acquire significant project experiance working both individually and in a group setting". For this project, my group of 4 was tasked with creating a math game for elementary school students. Working in a group of mostly seniors as a sophmore, I had to determine how best I could contribute to the group due to my lower coding skill. What I ended up doing was teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to do much of the front end work for the project. Even at a lower skill level than the rest of my team, I was able to be just as helpful.

##Virtual Memory Manager
Homework_6
The Virtual Memory Mangaer that I created for my Operating Systems class is another example the Computer Science learning goal "Attain a system level understaning of the computer". In the assignment I was tasked with creating a virtual represntation of how memory is transformed from a logical address to a physicall address. Using concepts like the TLB, Page Table, Page Frames, Page Numbers and Offsets. I was able to not only transform logical address to physical address, but also return the value at that address. In essence, this program deminstrates how a program is able to values from memory.

##Knapsack Problem
Knapsack.py
The Knapsack program I wrote for Algorithims is a good example the Computer Science learning goal "To develop effective problem sovling skills". For this program I was asked to solve the Knapsack problem. You are given a sack that can only hold a certian amount of weight. You have mulitple objects you much pick from that each have a certain value and weight. The aim of this program was to design an algorthim that would most efficeintly (hold the objects that would give the hieghts total value) fill the knapsack. In order to accomplish this I had going through the steps of examining the problem, designing an algorithim, implement that algorithim, and debug and test that solution.
